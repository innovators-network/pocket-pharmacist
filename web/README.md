# Pocket Pharmacist Frontend
This directory contains the front-end part of the Pocket Pharmacist application, built with React.js, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and React-Bootstrap.

## Setup
1. Navigate to the `web/` directory: `cd web`
2. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Technologies
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive styling.
- **React-Bootstrap**: For Bootstrap components in React.

## Integration with Backend
- The React app will integrate with AWS Lex for chat functionality using the AWS Lex Web UI.
- Alternatively, it can call the backend's Public APIs directly if exposed via API Gateway.

## Next Steps
- Add a chat interface to interact with the AWS Lex bot (`PocketPharmacistBot`).
- Style the application to match the Pocket Pharmacist branding.
